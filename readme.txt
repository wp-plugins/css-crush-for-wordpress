Completely customise the columns on the administration screens with a nice drag and drop interface. 

By default, WordPress only shows a few built-in columns. This plugin will give you many additional columns. You will have full control over all columns for pages, posts, posttypes, media, links, comments and users. 

Add or remove columns, change their label, change their width and reorder them.

* Featured Image
* Excerpt
* Post Attachments
* Page Order
* Page Templates
* Post Formats

* Status

= Sortable Custom Columns for all Screens =

All of the new columns will have support for sorting with the <a href="http://www.codepress.nl/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/sortorder-addon/">sorting addon</a>.

By default WordPress let's you only sort by Title, Date, Comments and Author. This will make you be able to <strong>sort by ALL columns of ANY type</strong>. (columns that are added by other plugins are not supported)

It will work nice with other plugins and support their additional custom columns. A few examples of plugins that are supported: WordPress SEO by Yoast (Robots Meta), Post Admin Shortcuts (Pin), WP Show IDs (ID) and User Access Manager (Access), Co-Authors Plus and Advanced Custom Fields.
